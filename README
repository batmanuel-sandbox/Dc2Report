At this location is the AASTeX style file (aastex.cls), the skeleton file itself
(dc2report.tex), and a series of stub files for the various sections within the
report, each of which gets included when dc2report.tex is TeXed.

More information about the AASTeX article class is at 
http://ucpjournals.uchicago.edu/AAS/AASTeX.

There is also a sample chapter file "sampleChapter.tex" showing how to include
an EPS file and how to make a table. If you don't know how to make an EPS file
for graphics, here's how.

Step 1: Say, "David, can you make this into an EPS file for me?"

Step 2: I'll do it.


If you're not a TeX user, don't install and learn TeX just for this report;
check in (or send me) the plain text and graphics, and I'll set it for you.

On Mac and Linux, Tex-ify the report using the commands

latex dc2report
dvipdf dc2report

from the report directory. The product will be dc2report.pdf.

I'm happy to help with TeXnical questions.
