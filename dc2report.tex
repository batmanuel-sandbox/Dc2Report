\textbf{ABSTRACT}

\begin{quotation}\noindent%
This report describes the second in a series of formal prototypes of
the LSST Data Management System referred to as Data Challenge 2 (DC2).
The focus of this data challenge is integrating real scientific
algorithms that are important to LSST nightly processing into a
general pipeline processing framework and then using the system to
process real astronomical data from a large CCD mosaic.  We enumerate the goals and
metrics for DC2, summarize the architecture of the DC2 pipeline
system, and review the science application and middleware
components that make up the system.  Finally, we present the results
of executing DC2 on data from the CFHT Legacy Survey and highlight the
important conclusions that will be used as input into the next data
challenge.

\section{Software Framework}

Our software framework is the toolbox with which we've been able
construct a working DC2 components.  It starts with a software
development environment which includes tools and processes for design
and implementation of the code as well as system for compiling the
code into libraries in a consistant manner that accounts for all the
component interdependencies.  In this environment we have built up set
of reusable components that allow us to implement the scientific
algorithms.  These include components that provide access to
middleware capabilities ({\tt mwi}).  It also includes data structures
(such as an \code{Image}) central to building algorithm
implimentations as well as databases and database services.  Finally,
framework provides a middleware necessary for running pipelines.  At
the center of this is the pipeline framework for creating and
executing pipelines.  Also supporting pipelnes is the event-based
communication layer and the \textit{pipeline orchestration} layer used
for setting up and launching pipelines.

\section{Application Layer}

The preceding chapter described the software infrastructure upon 
which the DC2 pipeline was created and run. Although these
components are all a necessary part of DC2 --- and will continue
to play a role through the life of the LSST project --- none of them can
accurately be described as fundamentally astronomical or
photometric in nature. Instead, they form the framework upon which 
the actual science application is constructed. We turn now to 
a description of the application layer of DC2.
